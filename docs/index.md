# Introduction

Welcome to the Zap docs ðŸ‘‹

<br/>
Zap is an infrastructure project built on Fuel. Part of Zaps aim is to develop a fully customizable self-sovereign wallet using 
predicates, a program type within the Fuel ecosystem (Fuel-VM). The Zap wallet incorporates the ability to sign transactions 
with EVM-compatible browser extension wallets and/or any Ethereum library capable of signing EVM-style transactions (e.g., ethers-rs). 
This enables stateless account abstraction from traditional externally owned accounts.
