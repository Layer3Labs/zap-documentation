# Zap Docs:

Welcome to the Zap docs pages ðŸ‘‹

<br/>
Zap is an infrastructure project built on Fuel. Part of Zaps aim is to develop a fully customizable self-sovereign wallet using 
predicates, a program type within the Fuel-VM. The Zap wallet incorporates the ability to sign transactions 
with EVM-compatible browser extension wallets and/or any Ethereum library capable of signing EVM-style transactions (e.g., ethers-rs). 
This enables stateless account abstraction from traditional externally owned accounts.


<br/>

These docs pages cover the following:

- Zap RPC Details.
- list JSON-RPC API calls for both `eth_` and `zap_` namespace(s).
- Wallet Initialization.

<br/>

For an introduction to stateless account abstraction and why it is important to sustainability within the blockchain space, check out our [blog](https://mirror.xyz/0x2601161BAf71D434C376a54bF1814365eAEcb69f).
